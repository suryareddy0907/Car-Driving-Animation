### Gameplay

---

**Key Controls:**

    - [W] Accelerate
    - [S] Brake/Reverse
    - [A] Turn Left
    - [D] Turn Right
    - [Q] Pause
    - [E] Switch Camera Mode
    - [ESC] Quit Race

- Both cars start close to the finish line and have to wait 3 seconds to start racing.

- The first car to complete 3 laps wins.

- If the player quits the race, the opponent is officially the winner.

- There are 2 power-ups on the track, a speed booster (speed with 70% increase for 2 seconds) and a portal (instantaneously places the player car in a point ahead on the track).

- When the player car passes through a power-up, the player is forced to pick an obstacle from the 3 available in the obstacles area. Then, the player should place the chosen obstacle in any location on the track by clicking on it.

- The 3 types of obstacles are: dizzyness (turn left/right commands become switched for 4 seconds), slowness (speed decreased by 60% for 4 seconds) and blocking (car stuck in place for 3 seconds). When the player car hits an obstacle, the corresponding effect is applied.

- Only the player's car is affected by power-ups and obstacles.

- Collisions between vehicles have physical outcomes.

- When the player's car is off-track, its speed is decreased by 80%.
